# GitHub Copilot for API usage, data parsing, and error handling.
API Usage:
GitHub Copilot provides valuable support when working with API requests and responses. It offers intelligent suggestions and auto-completion for API endpoints, headers, and parameters. This makes it easier to construct HTTP requests and ensures the correct formatting of API calls. Copilot can also assist with API authentication, such as generating and including API keys or tokens required for accessing protected endpoints.

Data Parsing:
Parsing weather data from the API response is made simpler with the help of GitHub Copilot. Copilot can suggest code snippets or functions that efficiently extract the relevant information from the JSON or XML data returned by the API. It assists in handling different data structures, such as nested objects and arrays, by providing suggestions for accessing specific data elements or iterating through collections.

Error Handling:
Implementing robust error handling mechanisms is crucial when working with APIs. GitHub Copilot offers valuable assistance in this area. It can suggest error handling code for various scenarios, including network errors, API rate limits, or invalid responses. Copilot helps in detecting and handling exceptions by providing suggestions for try-catch blocks or error status code checks. This ensures that the Weather Forecasting Tool can gracefully handle unexpected errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
